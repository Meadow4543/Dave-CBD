            <h1>What is CBD?</h1>
            <p>
               CBD, which is short for cannabidiol, is a compound
               found naturally in hemp plants. It is the second most prevalent
               of the active ingredients of cannabis, the first being THC. CBD is
               an essential component of medical marijuana and does not cause a high.
               As a safe and non-addictive substance, 
               CBD is one of more than a hundred "phytocannabinoids", which interact 
               with out body's receptors to produce therapeutic effects.

               CBD is a popular natural remedy used for many commmon ailments.
               It is often used to releive pain, reduce anxiety and depression, and help treat other types of illnesses.
               Studies have shown that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity, 
               reducing inflammation and interacting with neurotransmitters. 
               Another small experiment in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology found
               that CBD seemed to reduce nervousness and cognitive impairment
               in patients with social anxiety in a simulated public speaking task.

            <p>
               It really depends on what your goal is and why your'e taking CBD. 
               The biggest difference between all of the options is how fast it starts
               to affect you and how long it lasts.

               <p>
               Oils are the most versatile and common product. They offer the user a high
               bioavailability, which means they are absorbed 
               and used by your system efficiently. They are easy to use, all you have to 
               do is place the desired amount of the oil under your tongue using the dropper
               , and wait a few seconds before swallowing.

               <p>
                  Edibles take a bit more time to have an affect, but the effects last 
                  longer. It can take up to 2 hours to have an affect. Unlike the oil, edibles provide
                  a pre-measured dose and taste much better.
